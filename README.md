# Sonic 2 SMS Remake PS3
A port of the fangame **Sonic 2 SMS Remake** for the **PS3**.

**1. Competition has been removed.** Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement it.

**2. If you evoke "SAVING" in a row, the game will freeze for a few seconds (10~15s).** This is due to how the PS3 saving system works.
To avoid this, especially in the menu selection, **when "SAVING" shows up, wait a few seconds until it finishes.**
You do not need to wait during main gameplay, since "SAVING" only happens in the end of each Act.3.

3. The save file won't have the identification of the game name in the PS3 OS. It will be a generic icon, without name.


**Notes:**

So that the PS3 can run the game at a consistent 60 FPS with good performance, the following graphical downgrades had to be made:

1. Sky High Act 2 had to have the rain animation effect removed. The rain is static.
2. Gimmick MT. zones may experience tubes popping-in while you progress in the levels. This is an object optimization that had to be made for performance.


**Big Special Thanks goes to**: Creative Araya, SilicaAndPina, **MEGAgameBoy**, **DropSonic** and the **Sonic Time Twisted Devs**.
